# All-Textbook-Projects
This repository serves as both storage and as an indicator of my progress as I learn about computer science and low-level programming through the C language. I used K.N. King's *C Programming: A Modern Approach - Second Edition* to learn C and program small projects.

This repository includes a complete list of all the programming projects I've completed from *C Programming: A Modern Approach - Second Edition* as well as some small, other projects I've done. These are found under *Other Small Projects.*

Files under *Given Examples* are C files of completed examples provided in the textbook.

You can find all the projects I've done, which correspond to a C file in the repository, in the list below:
